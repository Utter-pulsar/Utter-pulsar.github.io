## About Me

Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a core developer and project manager at Moham Digital Technology Co., Ltd., 
focusing on large language model applications. 
My work includes leading projects such as RAG-Agent and Text2SQL while utilizing frameworks like LangChain, ModelScope, and Camel-AI. 
In addition to large language models, I have contributed to diverse AI applications, including knowledge graphs, 
mechanical design, speech-to-text systems, and 3D posture detection, delivering comprehensive AI algorithm support for my organization.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics and Robotic Systems from [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn). 
During my undergraduate studies, under the guidance of [Prof. Chun Zhao](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ChunZhao), 
I participated in [RoboMaster 2019](https://www.robomaster.com/) as a vision team member, where I gained hands-on experience in robotics competitions. 
Separately, my final year project, supervised by [Prof. 
Quan Zhang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/QuanZhang) and [Prof. Min Chen](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/MinChen), focused on developing an industrial robotic system that integrated voice and vision recognition for control.

I later earned a Master’s degree in Biorobotics from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), 
under the mentorship of [Dr. Dandan Zhang](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/d.zhang17) and [Prof. Nathan Lepora](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Nathan-Lepora-83045353-295f-488f-8720-e19648954fba/). My research concentrated on reinforcement learning algorithms for [tactile sensors](https://github.com/ac-93/tactile_gym), 
utilizing advanced simulation platforms such as [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/index.html).

With a strong foundation in robotics and AI, 
I am passionate about applying cutting-edge technologies to solve multidisciplinary challenges and drive innovation.
